I am a PhD student in Probability and Stochastic Analysis at the University of Edinburgh supervised by [Lukasz Szpruch](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~lszpruch/) and [David Siska](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~dsiska/). I am currently working on Deep Learning based algorithms for approximation of non-linear path-dependent PDEs.

Main Projects
-------
* Unbiased Deep Solvers for parametric PDEs ([Code](https://github.com/msabvid/Deep-PDE-Solvers)), ([arixv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05094))
* Robust Pricing and Hedging via Neural SDEs ([Code](https://github.com/msabvid/robust_nsde)), ([arixv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04154))
